Sadat realized that reaching a settlement of the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict is a precondition for Egyptian development. To achieve this goal, Sadat ventured to enhance US\u2013Egyptian relations to foster a peace process with Israel. After a seven-year hiatus, both countries reestablished normal diplomatic relations on February 28, 1974.Following the peace treaty with Israel, between 1979 and 2003, the US has provided Egypt with about $19 billion in military aid, making Egypt the second largest non-NATO recipient of US military aid after Israel. Also, Egypt received about $30 billion in economic aid within the same time frame. In 2009, the US provided a military assistance of US$1.3 billion (inflation adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|1.3|2009|r=2}}}} billion in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}), and an economic assistance of US$250 million (inflation adjusted US$ {{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|2009|r=1}}}} million in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}}). In 1989 both Egypt and Israel became a Major non-NATO ally of the United States.Military cooperation between the US and Egypt is probably the strongest aspect of their strategic partnership. General Anthony Zinni, the former Commandant of the US Central Command (CENTCOM), once said, \"Egypt is the most important country in my area of responsibility because of the access it gives me to the region.\" Egypt was also described during the Clinton Administration as the most prominent player in the Arab world and a key US ally in the Middle East. US military assistance to Egypt was considered part of the administration's strategy to maintaining continued availability of Persian Gulf energy resources and to secure the Suez Canal, which serves both as an important international oil route and as critical route for US warships transiting between the Mediterranean and either the Indian Ocean or the Persian Gulf.The Egyptian military provides indirect support for the foreign policy of Egypt in the region. Egypt is the strongest military power on the African continent, and the whole Middle EastDespite differences and periods of friction in relations between the two countries, the US-Egyptian relations under Mubarak have evolved moving beyond the Middle East peace process towards an independent bilateral friendship. It was in the US interest that Egypt was able to present moderate voice in Arab councils and persuade other Arab states to join the peace process and to normalize their relations with the US.However lately Egyptian-American relations have become a little tense. This is due to a great extent to the Egyptian unwillingness to send troops to Afghanistan and Iraq in peace stabilization missions. Egypt strongly backed the US in its war against international terrorism after the September 11 attacks, but refused to send troops to Afghanistan during the war and after it. Egypt also opposed US military intervention of March 2003 in Iraq, continued to oppose US occupation of the country after the war and further refused to comply with US requests to send troops to the country even under a UN umbrella.The issue of participation in the post-war construction efforts in Iraq has been controversial in Egypt and in the Arab world as a whole. Opponents say that the war was illegal and it is necessary to wait until Iraq has legal representative government to deal with it. On the other hand, supporters of participation argued that the responsibility to protect Iraqis and to help them in time of crisis should prevail and guide the Egyptian action in Iraq, despite the fact that the Iraqis do not agree.{{Update|section|date=December 2018}} On January 21, 2012, the U.S. Secretary of Transportation Ray LaHood's son, Sam, was detained by the Egyptian government and not allowed to leave the country as part of a politically charged criminal investigation by the Egyptian government into the activities of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) monitoring local elections in Egypt. LaHood's son is the Egypt director of the International Republican Institute. The Egyptian government has detained twelve NGO representatives from leaving Egypt.On February 5, 2012, Egyptian authorities charged LaHood's son and 42 other individuals with \"spending money from organizations that were operating in Egypt without a license.\" Nineteen Americans are part of the 42 charged. The U.S. government has made it clear that $1.5 billion in U.S. aid to Egypt could be withheld if the investigation is not finished quickly. Faiza Abu Naga, Egypt's Minister of International Cooperation, is seen as the person pushing the investigation forward, straining U.S. and Egypt relations.\nEgypt has an embassy in Washington, DC and consulates-general in Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles and New York City.\nUnited States has an embassy in Cairo.", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "{{flag|Uruguay}}", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "See Egypt\u2013Uruguay relations\nEgypt has an embassy in Montevideo.\nUruguay has an embassy in Cairo.", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}], [{"text": "{{flag|Venezuela}}", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}, {"text": "||\nEgypt has an embassy in Caracas.\nVenezuela has an embassy in Cairo.", "isNumeric": false, "links": []}]]}
