Believing that Caz has been murdered and Maria is the culprit, DS MacKinnon has her arrested. However, it later emerges that Caz is alive and is framing Maria in an act of revenge for being evicted from 2a Coronation Street. Despite being released on the charge of murder, Maria is arrested again due to the fact that she revealed to DS MacKinnon during an interview that she had organised a sham marriage between herself and Pablo Duarte (Shai Matheson) in order to grant him residence in the country. Maria is ordered to serve a 12 month custodial sentence, but ends up serving a couple of months before she is released on a tag. DS MacKinnon is the lead officer investigating an attack on Ken Barlow (William Roache). DS MacKinnon suspects that someone close to Ken was behind the attack and calls for an interview with all of Ken's closest relatives, Peter Barlow (Chris Gascoyne), Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), Adam Barlow (Sam Robertson) and Daniel Osbourne (Rob Mallard). However, while investigating the family, DS MacKinnon is led to believe that the attacker was Pat Phelan (Connor McIntyre) due to countless reports of him and Ken arguing over the building work going on at No. 1. DS MacKinnon releases Phelan after Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley) provides CCTV footage of Phelan's whereabouts at the time that Ken was attacked. After arresting and charging both Tracy and Adam for the attack, DS MacKinnon eventually realises that Daniel is the real culprit, however upon Daniel being declared psychologically unwell and Ken promising to tell the jury that he tripped and fell in court to protect Daniel, DS MacKinnon is forced to drop the case.
